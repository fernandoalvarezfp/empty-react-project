# empty-react-project

A clean, minimal React project with Vite and React Compiler - **stripped of all boilerplate content**.

## Purpose

This project provides a clean starting point for React development with:
- **Vite** (using Rolldown) for fast builds
- **React Compiler** (Babel plugin) for automatic optimization
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **No boilerplate content** - just the essential structure

Unlike the default Vite template, this project removes all example code and styling, giving you a truly empty canvas to start your React application.
